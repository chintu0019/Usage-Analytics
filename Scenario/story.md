# USAGE ANALYTICS EXPERIMENT - Odoo Notes

## Scenario
You are working in a software company and use Odoo10 Notes tool to manage software projects. The software company is currently working on project X. This project involves development of a chat application, currently working on providing an update. The current iteration includes the development team, testing and a design team. The development team has finished working on the chat feature and should start working on the Search Function, the testing team should test the chat function and the design team should design a new functionality (feature).

The teams are the __RED__ team (*Development*), the __PURPLE__ team (Software *testing*), and the __BLUE__ team (*Design*). Each team has different responsibilities and depending on the your chosen team, you are required to perform the tasks as described below.
All tasks are required to be performed using Odoo notes application.


## Experiment Guidelines:
Odoo notes is a kanban-style application, for the purpose of this experiment all the notes (sticky notes) are assigned to a team using a color and a tag (and the new ones should be similarly marked) depending on the team you are assigned.
You are allowed to delete and edit the notes created by you/your team (can be recognised by the team color) and should assign the same color for all the new notes created by you.
For example, if you belong to PURPLE team, you can edit or delete notes with PURPLE color and assign PURPLE color to all the notes created by you. But you can comment on any appropriate note as required depending on the task.



## The situation is:
### PURPLE TEAM:
You are PURPLE team (testing team) manager.
The RED team is the development team finished the chat function and so it should be tested by the PURPLE team.

You are required to perform the following tasks:
- refer to design team notes (BLUE) and development team notes (RED) on the chat function (use search box on the top right - search with note and/or tag)
- you can re-use the existing notes (related and necessary) by changing the color to PURPLE
- consult the RED and BLUE team about the chat function for any clarification required (may create new PURPLE note or comment on the existing RED note)
- create new testing related tasks (what software testing tasks should be performed) and assign the tasks to your team members (add team member as a follower to the note)
- inform the team member(s) over a chat about the new task assigned to them (mention the user in the chat)
- include "more" information on the task in the comments section of the note (task note created by you, which you have assigned to your team), attach the testing guidelines document in the comment
- remove follower from older/completed notes
- you encountered a bug and have to report to the development team to fix it
- suggestions to design team (BLUE color) on improvement of the product under development (may create multiple notes)
- delete unnecessary notes (non-color-coded or old PURPLE notes)
- move notes to appropriate columns
- search created notes and correct any typos
- create a messaging channel for you team and inform the design decisions on the new chat function to be developed
- unfollow from spam messaging channels



## The situation is:
### RED TEAM:
You are RED team (development team) manager.
The RED team should start working so that the Search Function goes in subdirectories.

You are required to perform the following tasks:
- refer to design team notes (BLUE) on the Search Function (use search box on the top right - search with note and/or tag)
- you can re-use the existing notes (related and necessary) by changing the color to RED
- consult the design team about the Search Function (may create new RED notes or comment on the related existing BLUE notes)
- create and assign development tasks for your team (create RED notes and add team member as a follower to the note)
- inform the assigned team members about the task(s) to be performed over a chat (mention the user in the chat)
- include "more" information on the task in the comment section of the note (task note created by you, which you assigned to your team), - attach the development guidelines document in the comment
- create note(s) for the testing team to refer later
- remove follower from older/completed notes
- suggestions to design team (BLUE color) on improvement of the product under development (may create multiple notes)
- delete unnecessary notes (non-color-coded or old RED notes)
- move notes to appropriate columns
- search created notes and correct any typos
- create a messaging channel for you team and inform the development decisions on the Search Function
- unfollow from spam messaging channels



## The situation is:
### BLUE TEAM:
You are BLUE team (design team) manager.
Your team is responsible for designing new functionalities (features) and/or updating the old ones, you are required to improve the chat functionality (currently the application allows one-to-one chats), you should come up with ideas and design the new feature. The RED and PURPLE teams might have some suggestions, you should discuss it with the RED and PURPLE team.

You are required to perform the following tasks:
- refer to development (RED) and testing (PURPLE) team notes for suggestions (use search box on the top right - search with note and/or tag)
- you can re-use the existing notes (related and necessary) by changing the color to BLUE
- respond to the suggestions in the comments section
- create a new note (BLUE) for each new idea and briefly describe the idea
- create tasks (new notes) to perform for your team members and assign them to the note (add team member as a follower to the note)
- attach the design principles document to the created note
- inform the assigned team members about the task(s) to be performed over a chat (mention the user in the chat)
- move notes to the appropriate column
- create a messaging channel for you team and inform the design decisions on the new chat function to be developed
- unfollow from spam messaging channels
- delete unnecessary notes (non-color-coded or old PURPLE notes)
- move notes to appropriate columns
- search created notes and correct any typos
- remove follower from older/completed notes
