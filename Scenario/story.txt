You are working in a software company and this Odoo10 Notes is
about a software project. The project result should allow to
manage document files.

The teams are the Yellow team, the Green team, and the Blue team.
You act as manager and work in the Blue team.

The situation is:

The Yellow team finished the Normalization Function and so it should
be tested by the Green team.

The Yellow team should start working so that the Search Function
goes in subdirectories.


You are in the Blue team, it is unclear what does "similar enough"
means, you should ask more in the chat.
