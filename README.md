# Usage-Analytics
A massive repository contains three different parts:

- **Custom versions of Odoo community application** (docker versions 10 and 11). The Odoo application is customised to generate custom logs which forms the basis for customer usage data.

- **Core of the repository, the analysis code** built on *python* and *linux bash scripts*. The analysis part of the repository is built to extract, process and analyse the usage data from the odoo application to understand the usage patterns and usage behaviour of the user. 

- **Dataset** for analysis, the *Usage data*.
